The cylinder heads and exhaust headers  are visible on the rear sides which mimics the design of the classic airplane. The exhuast is hidden under the cowling and the link-type rear suspension can be seen just below the seat.

21,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

The Biplane design uses a V-4 engine with a girder fork in the front and rim mounted disc brakes.  The cylinder heads and exhaust headers  are visible on the rear sides which mimics the design of the classic airplane. The exhuast is hidden under the cowling and the link-type rear suspension can be seen just below the seat.    A futuristic display panel is built into the top of the bike instead of conventional meters and since this is only a concept bike there are no plans for commercialization as of yet.",4444245,2761,303,0,1203

74,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

Maruti has launched the WagonR S-CNG in India. It is available in two variants, LXI and LXI(O), priced at Rs 4.84 lakh and Rs 4.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), respectively. It comes within two months after the Next-gen WagonR went on sale in the country in January 2019.  The WagonR S-CNG has been launched in select states though. It will be sold in Delhi-NCR, Gujarat, Mumbai, Pune, parts of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as these states have suitable CNG fuel infrastructure.  Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG with the 1.0-litre petrol engine (K10B) only. This engine has been carried over from the last-gen WagonR, and was available with the CNG option previously as well. The current Alto K10 CNG and Celerio CNG are also powered by this engine.  With CNG, the 1.0-litre engine produces 58BHP of power and 78NM of torque, which is similar to what it produces in the CNG versions of the Alto K10 and Celerio. This makes it around 9BHP less powerful than its petrol-powered version, but identical to the Santro CNG. The WagonR CNG has a claimed fuel economy of 33.54 km/kg, whereas the same for the Santro CNG is 30.48km/kg. Maruti Suzuki claims that the 2019 WagonR S-CNG is 26 per cent more fuel efficient than the outgoing WagonR CNG.  While the WagonR 1.0 can be had with an AMT as well (in the V variant), the WagonR CNG can only be had with a 5-speed MT, as it is being offered in the L and L(O) variants only. Hyundai also offers the Santro CNG with a 5-speed MT only.  Unlike the Santro CNG, which is available in the mid-spec variants (Magna and Sportz), Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG in the base LXi and the LXi(O) variants only. It gets features such as driver airbag, ABS with EBD, front seatbelt reminder, speed alert system, rear parking sensors, roof antenna, body-coloured bumpers, manual AC and front power windows. The LXi(O) variant, however, gets extra features like Passenger Airbag and Front Seat Belts with Pretensioners and Load limiters.  The new 2019 Wagon R is now longer by 56 mm at 3,655 mm and wider by 125 mm at 1,620 mm, but it's also shorter now by 25 mm at 1,675 mm. However, the car does have a 35 mm longer wheelbase now at 2,435 mm. This means there is more space inside the cabin and ground clearance stands at 170mm.  Due to Suzuki’s Heartect platformwhich has allowed in weight reduction of 65 kgs, when compared to old WagonR.  At a price of Rs 4.84 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), the Wagon R CNG is priced at a premium of Rs 65,000 over the LXI petrol. The Santro CNG, available in Magna and Sportz variants, is priced at Rs 5.24 lakh and Rs 5.65 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) respectively.  Colour Options : Superior White, Silky Silver & Magma Grey.

The Biplane design uses a V-4 engine with a girder fork in the front and rim mounted disc brakes.  The cylinder heads and exhaust headers  are visible on the rear sides which mimics the design of the classic airplane. The exhuast is hidden under the cowling and the link-type rear suspension can be seen just below the seat.    A futuristic display panel is built into the top of the bike instead of conventional meters and since this is only a concept bike there are no plans for commercialization as of yet.",4444245,2761,303,0,1203

125,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

174,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

223,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

The Biplane design uses a V-4 engine with a girder fork in the front and rim mounted disc brakes.  The cylinder heads and exhaust headers  are visible on the rear sides which mimics the design of the classic airplane. The exhuast is hidden under the cowling and the link-type rear suspension can be seen just below the seat.

Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

325,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

The Biplane design uses a V-4 engine with a girder fork in the front and rim mounted disc brakes.  The cylinder heads and exhaust headers  are visible on the rear sides which mimics the design of the classic airplane. The exhuast is hidden under the cowling and the link-type rear suspension can be seen just below the seat.    A futuristic display panel is built into the top of the bike instead of conventional meters and since this is only a concept bike there are no plans for commercialization as of yet.",4444271,2761,303,0,1203

374,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

426,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

479,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.

536,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

The cylinder heads and exhaust headers  are visible on the rear sides which mimics the design of the classic airplane. The exhuast is hidden under the cowling and the link-type rear suspension can be seen just below the seat.

578,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,lG6igO7YNeI,2017 Suzuki Swift - Crash test,2017-06-01 13:32:26,"""TEST RESULTS  Comments The passenger compartment of the Swift remained stable in the frontal offset test.  Dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs for both the driver and passenger.  Suzuki showed that a similar level of protection would be provided to occupants of different sizes and to those sat in different positions.  In the full-width rigid barrier test, protection of the chest was marginal, both for the driver and the rear seat passenger.  Otherwise, protection of critical body areas was rated a good or adequate.  The Swift scored maximum points in both the side barrier test and the more severe side pole impact, with good protection of all critical body regions.  Tests on the front seats and head restraints demonstrated good protection against whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. However, a geometric assessment of the rear seats indicated poor whiplash protection for occupants in those seating positions.  The Swift has, as part of its 'Radar Brake Support' option pack, autonomous. emergency braking.  The system works at the low speeds, typical of city driving, at which many whiplash injuries are caused and, in tests of this functionality, the system performed adequately.  CHILD OCCUPANT  Comments In the frontal offset test, readings from the 6 year dummy indicated poor chest protection and weak protection of the neck.  For the 10 year dummy, neck protection was marginal.  In the side barrier test, decelerations in the chest indicated poor protection of the 10 year dummy. Protection in this test was, otherwise, good.  The front passenger airbag can be disabled to allow a rearward-facing child restraint to be used in that seating position.  Clear information is provided regarding the status of the airbag and the system was rewarded.  All of the restraint types for the which the Swift is designed could be properly installed and accommodated.  PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION  Comments The protection provided by the bonnet to the head of a struck pedestrian was predominantly good or adequate, with poor results recorded on the stiff windscreen pillars.  The bumper scored maximum points, offering good protection to pedestrians' legs at all test locations.  Protection of the pelvis was predominantly good but some weak and poor results were also recorded.  SAFETY ASSIST  Comments The Swift has, as standard, as seatbelt reminder system for the front and rear seats.  Autonomous emergency braking is included in the 'Radar Brake Support' option pack.  Tests of its functionality at highway speeds showed good performance.  A driver-set speed limiter is available as an option, separate from the pack.

If you’re buying it for fun and excitement, however, along with a good dose of solid off-road capability, then I reckon you’re barking up the right tree.  Throw some decent rubber onto it, and you’ll have something capable of taking on some tough tracks, as well as plastering a big, ridiculous smile across your face. It’s a modern classic in my books, and I would love to own one.  -------------------------------------------------------------  CarAdvice.com is where Australians turn to for the most comprehensive independent reviews of new cars.

There is only one trim available for the new Jimny and a choice between automatic and manual transmissions.  The new Suzuki Jimny looks cool. Simple as that. It has a lot of classic style and it looks like it can climb a tree.   It has a 1.5-litre VVT petrol engine 75 kW of power and 130 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption is listed at 6.4 l per 100 km with the manual and 6.9 with the auto gearbox.  Suzuki’s new Jimny is sure to be a hit here in Australia where we love a good off road 4WD at an, especially affordable price.

It is pretty extreme due to the fact the water is deep and goes on for some distance.  If you enjoyed the video, please subscribe to my channel.  I update it regularly.  Please also share, comment and like.  Thank you for your support.  Disclaimer (Please read in full):  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME FOLKS!!  Until recently, I hadn't heard of green laning so I am fairly new to this as a lot of you know.  However, I am a very experienced off road/4x4 driver, having completed formal off road training with the military.  I have significant experience of driving off road and in very hostile conditions throughout Europe, Central America and Africa.  Indeed, prior to embarking on a driving expedition called The Roof of Africa (back in the 1980's), I received formal training by the Camel Trophy Team.  I feel comfortable driving solo in difficult terrain.    I am aware of the risks in driving through deep water and in this instance, although I have driven this lane quite a few times, the underwater terrain could be full of dangerous obstacles, for example, branches or root bundles that have moved with the force of the water.  I was prepared to abandon my vehicle if required and fully understood the risk of entering into deep water.  Please be advised.",1307,35,0,0,18

Le Katana est en plus à la fois une arme d'estoc et de taille véritable symbole associé au guerrier japonais.

If you’re buying it for fun and excitement, however, along with a good dose of solid off-road capability, then I reckon you’re barking up the right tree.  Throw some decent rubber onto it, and you’ll have something capable of taking on some tough tracks, as well as plastering a big, ridiculous smile across your face. It’s a modern classic in my books, and I would love to own one.  -------------------------------------------------------------  CarAdvice.com is where Australians turn to for the most comprehensive independent reviews of new cars.

There is only one trim available for the new Jimny and a choice between automatic and manual transmissions.  The new Suzuki Jimny looks cool. Simple as that. It has a lot of classic style and it looks like it can climb a tree.   It has a 1.5-litre VVT petrol engine 75 kW of power and 130 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption is listed at 6.4 l per 100 km with the manual and 6.9 with the auto gearbox.  Suzuki’s new Jimny is sure to be a hit here in Australia where we love a good off road 4WD at an, especially affordable price.

It is pretty extreme due to the fact the water is deep and goes on for some distance.  If you enjoyed the video, please subscribe to my channel.  I update it regularly.  Please also share, comment and like.  Thank you for your support.  Disclaimer (Please read in full):  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME FOLKS!!  Until recently, I hadn't heard of green laning so I am fairly new to this as a lot of you know.  However, I am a very experienced off road/4x4 driver, having completed formal off road training with the military.  I have significant experience of driving off road and in very hostile conditions throughout Europe, Central America and Africa.  Indeed, prior to embarking on a driving expedition called The Roof of Africa (back in the 1980's), I received formal training by the Camel Trophy Team.  I feel comfortable driving solo in difficult terrain.    I am aware of the risks in driving through deep water and in this instance, although I have driven this lane quite a few times, the underwater terrain could be full of dangerous obstacles, for example, branches or root bundles that have moved with the force of the water.  I was prepared to abandon my vehicle if required and fully understood the risk of entering into deep water.  Please be advised.",1307,35,0,0,18

Maruti has launched the WagonR S-CNG in India. It is available in two variants, LXI and LXI(O), priced at Rs 4.84 lakh and Rs 4.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), respectively. It comes within two months after the Next-gen WagonR went on sale in the country in January 2019.  The WagonR S-CNG has been launched in select states though. It will be sold in Delhi-NCR, Gujarat, Mumbai, Pune, parts of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as these states have suitable CNG fuel infrastructure.  Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG with the 1.0-litre petrol engine (K10B) only. This engine has been carried over from the last-gen WagonR, and was available with the CNG option previously as well. The current Alto K10 CNG and Celerio CNG are also powered by this engine.  With CNG, the 1.0-litre engine produces 58BHP of power and 78NM of torque, which is similar to what it produces in the CNG versions of the Alto K10 and Celerio. This makes it around 9BHP less powerful than its petrol-powered version, but identical to the Santro CNG. The WagonR CNG has a claimed fuel economy of 33.54 km/kg, whereas the same for the Santro CNG is 30.48km/kg. Maruti Suzuki claims that the 2019 WagonR S-CNG is 26 per cent more fuel efficient than the outgoing WagonR CNG.  While the WagonR 1.0 can be had with an AMT as well (in the V variant), the WagonR CNG can only be had with a 5-speed MT, as it is being offered in the L and L(O) variants only. Hyundai also offers the Santro CNG with a 5-speed MT only.  Unlike the Santro CNG, which is available in the mid-spec variants (Magna and Sportz), Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG in the base LXi and the LXi(O) variants only. It gets features such as driver airbag, ABS with EBD, front seatbelt reminder, speed alert system, rear parking sensors, roof antenna, body-coloured bumpers, manual AC and front power windows. The LXi(O) variant, however, gets extra features like Passenger Airbag and Front Seat Belts with Pretensioners and Load limiters.  The new 2019 Wagon R is now longer by 56 mm at 3,655 mm and wider by 125 mm at 1,620 mm, but it's also shorter now by 25 mm at 1,675 mm. However, the car does have a 35 mm longer wheelbase now at 2,435 mm. This means there is more space inside the cabin and ground clearance stands at 170mm.  Due to Suzuki’s Heartect platformwhich has allowed in weight reduction of 65 kgs, when compared to old WagonR.  At a price of Rs 4.84 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), the Wagon R CNG is priced at a premium of Rs 65,000 over the LXI petrol. The Santro CNG, available in Magna and Sportz variants, is priced at Rs 5.24 lakh and Rs 5.65 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) respectively.  Colour Options : Superior White, Silky Silver & Magma Grey.

If you’re buying it for fun and excitement, however, along with a good dose of solid off-road capability, then I reckon you’re barking up the right tree.  Throw some decent rubber onto it, and you’ll have something capable of taking on some tough tracks, as well as plastering a big, ridiculous smile across your face. It’s a modern classic in my books, and I would love to own one.  -------------------------------------------------------------  CarAdvice.com is where Australians turn to for the most comprehensive independent reviews of new cars.

There is only one trim available for the new Jimny and a choice between automatic and manual transmissions.  The new Suzuki Jimny looks cool. Simple as that. It has a lot of classic style and it looks like it can climb a tree.   It has a 1.5-litre VVT petrol engine 75 kW of power and 130 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption is listed at 6.4 l per 100 km with the manual and 6.9 with the auto gearbox.  Suzuki’s new Jimny is sure to be a hit here in Australia where we love a good off road 4WD at an, especially affordable price.

It is pretty extreme due to the fact the water is deep and goes on for some distance.  If you enjoyed the video, please subscribe to my channel.  I update it regularly.  Please also share, comment and like.  Thank you for your support.  Disclaimer (Please read in full):  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME FOLKS!!  Until recently, I hadn't heard of green laning so I am fairly new to this as a lot of you know.  However, I am a very experienced off road/4x4 driver, having completed formal off road training with the military.  I have significant experience of driving off road and in very hostile conditions throughout Europe, Central America and Africa.  Indeed, prior to embarking on a driving expedition called The Roof of Africa (back in the 1980's), I received formal training by the Camel Trophy Team.  I feel comfortable driving solo in difficult terrain.    I am aware of the risks in driving through deep water and in this instance, although I have driven this lane quite a few times, the underwater terrain could be full of dangerous obstacles, for example, branches or root bundles that have moved with the force of the water.  I was prepared to abandon my vehicle if required and fully understood the risk of entering into deep water.  Please be advised.",1307,35,0,0,18

739,UCCkL9vhAXWN0onzBDn_uaWQ,h3n-mO_a3t0,Maruti Suzuki WagonR CNG 2019 | WagonR 2019 CNG Features | Interior and Exterior | Real-life Review,2019-03-16 15:41:17,"Hello Friends, PLEASE LIKE, SHARE & SUBSCRIBE.  Maruti has launched the WagonR S-CNG in India. It is available in two variants, LXI and LXI(O), priced at Rs 4.84 lakh and Rs 4.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), respectively. It comes within two months after the Next-gen WagonR went on sale in the country in January 2019.  The WagonR S-CNG has been launched in select states though. It will be sold in Delhi-NCR, Gujarat, Mumbai, Pune, parts of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as these states have suitable CNG fuel infrastructure.  Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG with the 1.0-litre petrol engine (K10B) only. This engine has been carried over from the last-gen WagonR, and was available with the CNG option previously as well. The current Alto K10 CNG and Celerio CNG are also powered by this engine.  With CNG, the 1.0-litre engine produces 58BHP of power and 78NM of torque, which is similar to what it produces in the CNG versions of the Alto K10 and Celerio. This makes it around 9BHP less powerful than its petrol-powered version, but identical to the Santro CNG. The WagonR CNG has a claimed fuel economy of 33.54 km/kg, whereas the same for the Santro CNG is 30.48km/kg. Maruti Suzuki claims that the 2019 WagonR S-CNG is 26 per cent more fuel efficient than the outgoing WagonR CNG.  While the WagonR 1.0 can be had with an AMT as well (in the V variant), the WagonR CNG can only be had with a 5-speed MT, as it is being offered in the L and L(O) variants only. Hyundai also offers the Santro CNG with a 5-speed MT only.  Unlike the Santro CNG, which is available in the mid-spec variants (Magna and Sportz), Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG in the base LXi and the LXi(O) variants only. It gets features such as driver airbag, ABS with EBD, front seatbelt reminder, speed alert system, rear parking sensors, roof antenna, body-coloured bumpers, manual AC and front power windows. The LXi(O) variant, however, gets extra features like Passenger Airbag and Front Seat Belts with Pretensioners and Load limiters.  The new 2019 Wagon R is now longer by 56 mm at 3,655 mm and wider by 125 mm at 1,620 mm, but it's also shorter now by 25 mm at 1,675 mm. However, the car does have a 35 mm longer wheelbase now at 2,435 mm. This means there is more space inside the cabin and ground clearance stands at 170mm.  Due to Suzuki’s Heartect platformwhich has allowed in weight reduction of 65 kgs, when compared to old WagonR.  At a price of Rs 4.84 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), the Wagon R CNG is priced at a premium of Rs 65,000 over the LXI petrol. The Santro CNG, available in Magna and Sportz variants, is priced at Rs 5.24 lakh and Rs 5.65 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) respectively.  Colour Options : Superior White, Silky Silver & Magma Grey.

If you’re buying it for fun and excitement, however, along with a good dose of solid off-road capability, then I reckon you’re barking up the right tree.  Throw some decent rubber onto it, and you’ll have something capable of taking on some tough tracks, as well as plastering a big, ridiculous smile across your face. It’s a modern classic in my books, and I would love to own one.  -------------------------------------------------------------  CarAdvice.com is where Australians turn to for the most comprehensive independent reviews of new cars.

777,UC7svi-MSLZHpZQWREpSLBhw,Bs1P_wbGnA4,2019 Suzuki Jimny Review - Australia,2019-03-07 07:26:16,"Jenny reviews the latest 2019 Jimny from Suzuki. There is only one trim available for the new Jimny and a choice between automatic and manual transmissions.  The new Suzuki Jimny looks cool. Simple as that. It has a lot of classic style and it looks like it can climb a tree.   It has a 1.5-litre VVT petrol engine 75 kW of power and 130 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption is listed at 6.4 l per 100 km with the manual and 6.9 with the auto gearbox.  Suzuki’s new Jimny is sure to be a hit here in Australia where we love a good off road 4WD at an, especially affordable price.

It is pretty extreme due to the fact the water is deep and goes on for some distance.  If you enjoyed the video, please subscribe to my channel.  I update it regularly.  Please also share, comment and like.  Thank you for your support.  Disclaimer (Please read in full):  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME FOLKS!!  Until recently, I hadn't heard of green laning so I am fairly new to this as a lot of you know.  However, I am a very experienced off road/4x4 driver, having completed formal off road training with the military.  I have significant experience of driving off road and in very hostile conditions throughout Europe, Central America and Africa.  Indeed, prior to embarking on a driving expedition called The Roof of Africa (back in the 1980's), I received formal training by the Camel Trophy Team.  I feel comfortable driving solo in difficult terrain.    I am aware of the risks in driving through deep water and in this instance, although I have driven this lane quite a few times, the underwater terrain could be full of dangerous obstacles, for example, branches or root bundles that have moved with the force of the water.  I was prepared to abandon my vehicle if required and fully understood the risk of entering into deep water.  Please be advised.",1307,35,0,0,18

787,UCCkL9vhAXWN0onzBDn_uaWQ,h3n-mO_a3t0,Maruti Suzuki WagonR CNG 2019 | WagonR 2019 CNG Features | Interior and Exterior | Real-life Review,2019-03-16 15:41:17,"Hello Friends, PLEASE LIKE, SHARE & SUBSCRIBE.  Maruti has launched the WagonR S-CNG in India. It is available in two variants, LXI and LXI(O), priced at Rs 4.84 lakh and Rs 4.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), respectively. It comes within two months after the Next-gen WagonR went on sale in the country in January 2019.  The WagonR S-CNG has been launched in select states though. It will be sold in Delhi-NCR, Gujarat, Mumbai, Pune, parts of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as these states have suitable CNG fuel infrastructure.  Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG with the 1.0-litre petrol engine (K10B) only. This engine has been carried over from the last-gen WagonR, and was available with the CNG option previously as well. The current Alto K10 CNG and Celerio CNG are also powered by this engine.  With CNG, the 1.0-litre engine produces 58BHP of power and 78NM of torque, which is similar to what it produces in the CNG versions of the Alto K10 and Celerio. This makes it around 9BHP less powerful than its petrol-powered version, but identical to the Santro CNG. The WagonR CNG has a claimed fuel economy of 33.54 km/kg, whereas the same for the Santro CNG is 30.48km/kg. Maruti Suzuki claims that the 2019 WagonR S-CNG is 26 per cent more fuel efficient than the outgoing WagonR CNG.  While the WagonR 1.0 can be had with an AMT as well (in the V variant), the WagonR CNG can only be had with a 5-speed MT, as it is being offered in the L and L(O) variants only. Hyundai also offers the Santro CNG with a 5-speed MT only.  Unlike the Santro CNG, which is available in the mid-spec variants (Magna and Sportz), Maruti is offering the WagonR CNG in the base LXi and the LXi(O) variants only. It gets features such as driver airbag, ABS with EBD, front seatbelt reminder, speed alert system, rear parking sensors, roof antenna, body-coloured bumpers, manual AC and front power windows. The LXi(O) variant, however, gets extra features like Passenger Airbag and Front Seat Belts with Pretensioners and Load limiters.  The new 2019 Wagon R is now longer by 56 mm at 3,655 mm and wider by 125 mm at 1,620 mm, but it's also shorter now by 25 mm at 1,675 mm. However, the car does have a 35 mm longer wheelbase now at 2,435 mm. This means there is more space inside the cabin and ground clearance stands at 170mm.  Due to Suzuki’s Heartect platformwhich has allowed in weight reduction of 65 kgs, when compared to old WagonR.  At a price of Rs 4.84 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), the Wagon R CNG is priced at a premium of Rs 65,000 over the LXI petrol. The Santro CNG, available in Magna and Sportz variants, is priced at Rs 5.24 lakh and Rs 5.65 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) respectively.  Colour Options : Superior White, Silky Silver & Magma Grey.

Le Katana est en plus à la fois une arme d'estoc et de taille véritable symbole associé au guerrier japonais.

The Intruder 150 is priced attractively to offer an alternative to the Bajaj Avenger cruiser series while having modern bits like fresh styling, all-digital instrument cluster, rear monoshock suspension, single-channel ABS and the likes.  The Suzuki Intruder 150 mileage is going to be the best in the segment although it is priced in Avenger 220 territory, it competes with the Avenger 150.  https://www.motorbeam.com  Become a #MotorBeamer: http://bit.ly/MotorBeamer  Visit our website: https://www.motorbeam.com  Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MotorBeam  Follow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/MotorBeam  Add us on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/MotorBeam  Follow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/MotorBeam  Check us out on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/motorbeam  +1 us on Google Plus: https://plus.google.com/+motorbeam  Music Credits:  Beach by MBB https://soundcloud.com/mbbofficial Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported — CC BY-SA 3.0  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...
