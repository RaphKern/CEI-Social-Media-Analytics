15,UCs_gcVRMHEx5mVXfQ7icQTg,2S4Khbv6iSw,2018 Hyundai Azera - interior Exterior and Drive,2017-06-26 13:45:36,"""The 2018 Hyundai Azera looks pretty classy   With the reveal of the new Azera, Hyundai has made it clear that it has no plans to leave the large, upscale sedan market. This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

20,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,mwx01FBf-KM,2017 Hyundai i30 - Perfect Car!!,2017-06-22 16:03:27,"""Hyundai i30 comes to America as the 2018 Elantra GT   At last year's Paris Auto Show, Hyundai revealed its clean and classy i30 hatchback, with the promise that it would arrive in the US as the Elantra GT. The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

34,UCOlVRU7y2R5OwL8xhjBbtHQ,APOMcxbDiIA,Hyundai NEXO - Because of you,2018-12-31 09:46:48,"El nuevo NEXO es para aquellos que les gusta cargar la batería de su coche en 5 minutos, para los que les gusta respirar aire puro, para los que buscan una vida más fácil y que los suyos vivan en un lugar mejor.  Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1964906,1859,1328,0,220

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1965013,1860,1328,0,220

De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1964906,1859,1328,0,220

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

117,UCs_gcVRMHEx5mVXfQ7icQTg,2S4Khbv6iSw,2018 Hyundai Azera - interior Exterior and Drive,2017-06-26 13:45:36,"""The 2018 Hyundai Azera looks pretty classy   With the reveal of the new Azera, Hyundai has made it clear that it has no plans to leave the large, upscale sedan market. This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

121,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,mwx01FBf-KM,2017 Hyundai i30 - Perfect Car!!,2017-06-22 16:03:27,"""Hyundai i30 comes to America as the 2018 Elantra GT   At last year's Paris Auto Show, Hyundai revealed its clean and classy i30 hatchback, with the promise that it would arrive in the US as the Elantra GT. The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

134,UCOlVRU7y2R5OwL8xhjBbtHQ,APOMcxbDiIA,Hyundai NEXO - Because of you,2018-12-31 09:46:48,"El nuevo NEXO es para aquellos que les gusta cargar la batería de su coche en 5 minutos, para los que les gusta respirar aire puro, para los que buscan una vida más fácil y que los suyos vivan en un lugar mejor.  Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1964906,1859,1328,0,220

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

172,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,mwx01FBf-KM,2017 Hyundai i30 - Perfect Car!!,2017-06-22 16:03:27,"""Hyundai i30 comes to America as the 2018 Elantra GT   At last year's Paris Auto Show, Hyundai revealed its clean and classy i30 hatchback, with the promise that it would arrive in the US as the Elantra GT. The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

187,UCOlVRU7y2R5OwL8xhjBbtHQ,APOMcxbDiIA,Hyundai NEXO - Because of you,2018-12-31 09:46:48,"El nuevo NEXO es para aquellos que les gusta cargar la batería de su coche en 5 minutos, para los que les gusta respirar aire puro, para los que buscan una vida más fácil y que los suyos vivan en un lugar mejor.  Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1964906,1859,1328,0,220

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

274,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,mwx01FBf-KM,2017 Hyundai i30 - Perfect Car!!,2017-06-22 16:03:27,"""Hyundai i30 comes to America as the 2018 Elantra GT   At last year's Paris Auto Show, Hyundai revealed its clean and classy i30 hatchback, with the promise that it would arrive in the US as the Elantra GT. The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

288,UCOlVRU7y2R5OwL8xhjBbtHQ,APOMcxbDiIA,Hyundai NEXO - Because of you,2018-12-31 09:46:48,"El nuevo NEXO es para aquellos que les gusta cargar la batería de su coche en 5 minutos, para los que les gusta respirar aire puro, para los que buscan una vida más fácil y que los suyos vivan en un lugar mejor.  Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1965013,1860,1328,0,220

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

321,UCs_gcVRMHEx5mVXfQ7icQTg,2S4Khbv6iSw,2018 Hyundai Azera - interior Exterior and Drive,2017-06-26 13:45:36,"""The 2018 Hyundai Azera looks pretty classy   With the reveal of the new Azera, Hyundai has made it clear that it has no plans to leave the large, upscale sedan market. This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

324,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,mwx01FBf-KM,2017 Hyundai i30 - Perfect Car!!,2017-06-22 16:03:27,"""Hyundai i30 comes to America as the 2018 Elantra GT   At last year's Paris Auto Show, Hyundai revealed its clean and classy i30 hatchback, with the promise that it would arrive in the US as the Elantra GT. The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

340,UCOlVRU7y2R5OwL8xhjBbtHQ,APOMcxbDiIA,Hyundai NEXO - Because of you,2018-12-31 09:46:48,"El nuevo NEXO es para aquellos que les gusta cargar la batería de su coche en 5 minutos, para los que les gusta respirar aire puro, para los que buscan una vida más fácil y que los suyos vivan en un lugar mejor.  Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1965467,1860,1333,0,221

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

372,UCs_gcVRMHEx5mVXfQ7icQTg,2S4Khbv6iSw,2018 Hyundai Azera - interior Exterior and Drive,2017-06-26 13:45:36,"""The 2018 Hyundai Azera looks pretty classy   With the reveal of the new Azera, Hyundai has made it clear that it has no plans to leave the large, upscale sedan market. This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

376,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,mwx01FBf-KM,2017 Hyundai i30 - Perfect Car!!,2017-06-22 16:03:27,"""Hyundai i30 comes to America as the 2018 Elantra GT   At last year's Paris Auto Show, Hyundai revealed its clean and classy i30 hatchback, with the promise that it would arrive in the US as the Elantra GT. The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

391,UCOlVRU7y2R5OwL8xhjBbtHQ,APOMcxbDiIA,Hyundai NEXO - Because of you,2018-12-31 09:46:48,"El nuevo NEXO es para aquellos que les gusta cargar la batería de su coche en 5 minutos, para los que les gusta respirar aire puro, para los que buscan una vida más fácil y que los suyos vivan en un lugar mejor.  Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1965467,1860,1333,0,221

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

424,UCs_gcVRMHEx5mVXfQ7icQTg,2S4Khbv6iSw,2018 Hyundai Azera - interior Exterior and Drive,2017-06-26 13:45:36,"""The 2018 Hyundai Azera looks pretty classy   With the reveal of the new Azera, Hyundai has made it clear that it has no plans to leave the large, upscale sedan market. This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

428,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,mwx01FBf-KM,2017 Hyundai i30 - Perfect Car!!,2017-06-22 16:03:27,"""Hyundai i30 comes to America as the 2018 Elantra GT   At last year's Paris Auto Show, Hyundai revealed its clean and classy i30 hatchback, with the promise that it would arrive in the US as the Elantra GT. The company has fulfilled that promise and then some, bringing us the same attractive hatch, but with even more power.  Visually and structurally, the car is pretty much identical. The lines aren't fussy, and the look is more upright than its predecessor. The interior is reasonably attractive, but we wish the infotainment display was better integrated with the dash like the Elantra sedan's dash.   The big differences are under the hood. The European i30 features an array of gas and diesel engines, and the most potent of which produced only about 140 horsepower. In the United States, the least powerful Elantra GT is the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 162 horsepower. And if that's not enough, a Sport version will be offered with Hyundai's 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter.  The Elantra GT Sport, like its sedan counterpart, also picks up a few other improvements. It trades in the standard hatch's torsion bar rear suspension for a multi-link set-up. It also moves up to 18-inch alloy wheels, instead of the standard 17-inch alloys, and larger front and rear disc brakes. The interior gets some sportier accoutrements, too.   All Elantra GTs will be available with a number of premium options, including leather, dual-zone climate control, cruise control with start and stop functionality, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist. You'll also be able to use Hyundai's Blue Link Alexa feature. Interested buyers will be able to check out an Elantra GT at dealer lots this summer, but Hyundai has not yet released pricing.

438,UCOlVRU7y2R5OwL8xhjBbtHQ,APOMcxbDiIA,Hyundai NEXO - Because of you,2018-12-31 09:46:48,"El nuevo NEXO es para aquellos que les gusta cargar la batería de su coche en 5 minutos, para los que les gusta respirar aire puro, para los que buscan una vida más fácil y que los suyos vivan en un lugar mejor.  Hemos creado en nuevo Hyundai NEXO porque no somos nada sin ti.  Es un SUV de pila de combustible único. Combina la tecnología más avanzada con un diseño futurista y una increíble autonomía.   El Hyundai NEXO se caracteriza por un diseño puro en el que destaca su silueta aerodinámica y su techo flotante. El frontal, de superficies fluidas, remarca una imagen ancha y claramente definida, con luces diurnas tipo led colocadas en posición horizontal. La rejilla en cascada se ha ampliado para aumentar la entrada de aire, mientras que en los laterales encontramos los primeros tiradores integrados de Hyundai. El objetivo es conseguir un diseño más limpio y mejorar el flujo de aire. El diseño distintivo de la carrocería se traslada al interior, donde encontramos un ancho frontal en el que sobresalen dos pantallas. La primera, de 12,3 pulgadas, contiene la información del sistema de navegación, mientras que la segunda, de 7 pulgadas, conforma la instrumentación digital; muestra la velocidad, el nivel de combustible y la eficiencia de conducción.  Pero lo realmente sorprendente del NEXO es su sistema de propulsión. Monta un motor eléctrico de 120 kW de potencia (equivalente a 163 CV), con un par de 395 Nm. Es capaz de acelerar de 0 a 100 km/h en 9,2 segundos y de alcanzar una velocidad máxima de 179 km/h. Más allá de sus prestaciones, el NEXO destaca por ofrecer una autonomía de 800 kilómetros por depósito, según el test de homologación NEDC. Esto se debe a su excelente eficiencia energética, del 60%, la mejor del mundo. Los ingenieros de Hyundai han trabajado para garantizar que pueda operar sin restricciones en condiciones climatológicas extremas. Así, es capaz de arrancar con temperaturas por debajo de -30ºC y mostrar un excelente rendimiento de refrigeración con temperaturas superiores a 49 ºC.  Este todocamino, además, será el encargado de estrenar algunas de las últimas tecnologías de asistencia a la conducción desarrolladas por Hyundai. Una de ellas es el nuevo monitor de ángulo muerto (Blind-spot View Monitor BVM), un sistema que no sólo alerta de la presencia de otros coches en los puntos ciegos del vehículo, sino que por primera vez en la industria automovilística muestra imágenes de lo que sucede a su alrededor a través de una pantalla situada en el cuadro de instrumentos. Para ello utiliza un sistema de cámaras gran angular en los laterales y en la trasera.  Otro de los avances tecnológicos es el asistente de mantenimiento de carril (Lane Following Assist LFA), que es capaz de realizar correcciones en la dirección de manera autónoma para garantizar que el vehículo se mantenga dentro de su propio carril. Este sistema funciona a velocidades de hasta 145 km/h. El dispositivo, además, se puede combinar con el Highway Driving Assist (HDA), un control de crucero adaptativo que utiliza sensores y datos cartográficos para mejorar el confort a bordo, la seguridad y la autonomía.  El Hyundai NEXO ofrecerá también un sistema de aparcamiento autónomo conocido como Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA). Gracias a él, el vehículo puede estacionar o salir de la plaza de aparcamiento en batería sin necesidad de que el conductor se encuentre en el interior del coche. De esta forma, el vehículo podrá realizar la maniobra de manera 100% autónoma mientras el conductor esté fuera con el mando en la mano.  ¡Sigue todas nuestras novedades!  ➡ Nuestra web: http://www.hyundai.es  ➡ Hyundai Experience: http://www.hyundai.es/experience ➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hyundai.es ➡ Twitter: https://twitter.com/HyundaiEsp ➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hyundaiesp",1965467,1860,1333,0,221

Ashish Masih tests it for us. It is launched in one of the highly competitive segment of the compact SUVs among the rivals like the Ford Ecosport and the Renault Duster. Hyundai Creta comes in a premium price range of Rs 9.22 Lakhs to Rs 14.57 Lakhs (Ex. Showroom, New Delhi). Hyundai has introduced the SUV in both petrol and diesel fuel trims. It can be availed in five variants in gasoline trim: E, E+, SX+ Manual, SX+ Manual Spl Edition and SX+ Automatic. On the other hand, the diesel variants are presented with two powertrains in a total of 9 variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, S+ Automatic, SX+ Spl Edition, SX (O), and SX+ Automatic. Needless to say, Hyundai Creta gets all the bells and whistles that one would have wished. On the safety front, it gets several premium and reliable features such as side and curtain airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management control (VSM), Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Rear parking camera, Lane Change Flash Adjustment and Speed sensing Auto Door lock. As for comfort and convenience, the SUV comes loaded with a plethora of exquisite features like automatic A/C with ion cluster, rear centre armrest with cup holders, electric tailgate release, height adjustable driver's seat, 7-inch touchscreen AVN system with 1 GB internal memory and bluetooth connectivity, etc. to name a few.  While the Creta has already received a rave response, the Maruti Suzuki S-Cross could play a spoilsport once launched. So, here's our video review of the Hyundai Creta compact SUV!

460,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,A5pUAMJ_gns,2019 Hyundai Palisade - Perfect SUV!,2018-12-15 10:50:07,"""All-New 2020 Hyundai Palisade Mid-size SUV       All-New 2020 Hyundai Palisade Flagship SUV Brings Exceptional Comfort, Technology and Safety in a Bold Midsize SUV     Palisade offers seating for up to eight and commodious cargo space with convenient features like power third-row seats and One-Touch second-row seats for ease of use     As Hyundai’s flagship SUV, Palisade offers a host of technology features ideal for family road trips including a 10-inch navigation display, wireless charging, seven USB outlets, second-row ventilated seats, shift-by-wire and innovative roof-based diffuser vents     Hyundai SmartSense technology comes standard on every Palisade Starting Pirce: $32.000  POWERTRAIN  Palisade power comes from an Atkinson-cycle 3.8-liter V6, dual CVVT, direct-injected engine, for excellent power and efficiency. This 3.8-liter powerplant produces an estimated 291 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm and an estimated 262 lb.-ft. of torque @ 5,000 rpm. Palisade offers more standard horsepower than any other SUV in its competitive set and an unsurpassed level of torque. Palisade delivers that power to the wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission with a multi-plate torque converter and offers both two-wheel and HTRAC® four-wheel-drive configurations, with a final drive ratio of 3.648 for confident acceleration. Special efforts were made to reduce Palisade NVH, with generous under-hood insulation, special sound-deadening carpets and powertrain tuning that delivers a smooth, linear response. In addition, Palisade offers drivers the ability to start the vehicle via remote key fob or via the Blue Link app.  FLAGSHIP SUV DESIGN  “Hyundai Palisade’s exterior and interior design clearly reflect its unique flagship identity with a premium, distinctive and bold road presence,” said SangYup Lee, head of Hyundai’s Design Center. “As the lead for Palisade design, it was a pleasure to work with our global design teams throughout its development and ultimately present this phenomenal product before you today.”  Palisade’s styling conveys dignity with style in an understated theme that demonstrates clear differentiation worthy of a flagship SUV. From the front, a dominant, bold and wide cascading grille clearly represents a premium SUV. Separated composite headlamps and a vertically-connected forward lighting signature create a strong and distinctive front demeanor, with available LED headlights, LED daytime running lights and LED turn-signal mirrors. A powerful, extended hood profile creates an impressive road presence, while bold C-pillars and a panoramic glass side graphic convey generous third-row spaciousness. Full volume over-fenders and body sides offer muscular detailing. The rear view emphasizes a wide and stable stance via sinuous detailing and a vertical LED rear taillamp design. Panoramic rear glass coupled with a cutaway roof provides a generous sense of spaciousness to rear passengers. Available oversized 20-inch alloy wheels further fill out the Palisade flagship presence.  This design has aerodynamic benefits as well, with a 0.33 coefficient of drag (Cd). Palisade achieves this low drag coefficient with specific design cues that include a fast A-pillar angle, a rear spoiler side garnish, an optimized front cooling area with an extended internal air guide, aero underside panels, and rear wheel aero deflectors.  INTUITIVE UTILITY  The interior design combines a sense of relaxation and comfort creating a serene environment with eight-passenger seating standard for family adventures. Leather-equipped models offer a premium, quilted Nappa leather, while on the instrument panel, smooth woodgrain trim in a wraparound interior design create a spacious, comfortable ambience. The One-Touch second row seat allows for one-touch operation of the seat forward and out of the way for easy access into and out of the third-row seat. For more convenience, the third row offers power-folding/unfolding and reclining seats. Second-row captain’s chairs are also available with ventilated seating surfaces. Every Palisade seating row offers USB outlets for convenience for all passengers, for a total of seven available USB outlets. Even more, a conversation mirror allows the driver to clearly see passengers in the rear.  Palisade also offers a class-exclusive Blind View Monitor that complements the standard Blind Spot Collision Avoidance Assist, which provides easy-to-see body-side views whenever the turn signal is activated. The audio and navigation display is a generous 10.25 inch touchscreen in widescreen format, coupled with a 12.3-inch fully-digital TFT center instrument cluster offering various view modes and differentiated drive mode illumination. Two Bluetooth® devices can be connected simultaneously, with one for a mobile phone connection and the other for audio streaming.

466,UCs_gcVRMHEx5mVXfQ7icQTg,2S4Khbv6iSw,2018 Hyundai Azera - interior Exterior and Drive,2017-06-26 13:45:36,"""The 2018 Hyundai Azera looks pretty classy   With the reveal of the new Azera, Hyundai has made it clear that it has no plans to leave the large, upscale sedan market. This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

For 2019, Hyundai is simplifying things with the Santa Fe Sport becoming just the Santa Fe and the 3-row version becoming the Palisade in 2020. Now in its 4th generation, this new model gains an 8-speed transmission and updated 4-cylinder engines with much improved fuel economy. Hyundai also took a bit more of a risk with the exterior and interior design and the result is a crossover that stands out from the crowd and provides an interesting option if you want something that is a little bigger then a compact but not quite a midsize SUV.""",266615,2455,152,0,810

503,UCGWNHkr2WZcRbxqoet-nyeg,ku8KLreAIjw,Hyundai Cradle Walking Car At CES 2019,2019-01-08 01:53:05,"""Any first responder will tell you that the first 72 hours following a natural disaster are the most crucial to saving lives. However, often times due to the nature of the disaster (forest fire, earthquake, hurricane, or flood), it can be difficult for search-and-rescue and humanitarian aid missions to reach and get immediate help to those in need.    The need for efficient, rapid, resilient transportation for disaster assistance is what led Hyundai to develop the first-ever vehicle with moveable legs. Elevate is the first Ultimate Mobility Vehicle (UMV), blending technology found in electric cars and robots, which allows it to traverse terrain beyond the limitations of even the most capable off-road vehicle.  """"When a tsunami or earthquake hits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field. They have to go the rest of the way by foot. Elevate can drive to the scene and climb right over flood debris or crumbled concrete,” said John Suh, Vice President and Head of Hyundai CRADLE. “This technology goes well beyond emergency situations. People living with disabilities worldwide that don’t have access to an ADA ramp could hail an autonomous Hyundai Elevate that could walk up to their front door, level itself, and allow their wheelchair to roll right in. The possibilities are limitless.”   The Elevate concept is based on a modular EV platform with the capability to switch out different bodies for specific situations. The robotic leg architecture has five degrees of freedom plus wheel hub propulsion motors and is enabled by the latest in electric actuator technology. This design is uniquely capable of both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits, allowing it to move in any direction.    The legs also fold up into a stowed drive-mode, where power to the joints is cut, and the use of an integrated passive suspension system maximizes battery efficiency. This allows Elevate to drive at highway speeds just like any other vehicle. But no other can climb a five foot wall, step over a five foot gap, walk over diverse terrain, and achieve a 15 foot wide track width, all while keeping its body and passengers completely level. Further, the combination of wheeled motion with articulating legs provides a new paradigm of mobility by enabling faster walking speeds, unique dynamic driving postures and torsional control at the end of each leg.   “By combining the power of robotics with Hyundai’s latest EV technology, Elevate has the ability to take people where no car has been before, and redefine our perception of vehicular freedom,” said David Byron, design manager, Sundberg-Ferar. “Imagine a car stranded in a snow ditch just 10 feet off the highway being able to walk or climb over the treacherous terrain, back to the road potentially saving its injured passengers – this is the future of vehicular mobility.”  Get More Great Car Videos - Subscribe: https://goo.gl/BSIaFc""",138215,2281,266,0,463

Tuy nhiên do nhiều khách hàng ở xa không có điều kiện đến xem xe thì có thể đặt mua xe từ xa. Đối với những chiếc xe bán từ xa thì Quang Tuấn Auto luôn có chế độ kiểm tra riêng biệt để hạn chế tối đa những bất tiện cho khách hàng khi nhận xe.  🌋 Để thực hiện phương thức mua bán từ xa (mua online), ban đầu quý khách hàng và Quang Tuấn Auto cần thống nhất chung về mức giá, phương thức vận chuyển, chi phí rút hồ sơ. Sau khi hai bên đã thống nhất xong thì quý khách vui lòng chuyển cho Quang Tuấn Auto 30 triệu tiền cọc để rút hồ sơ (nếu cần sang tên chính chủ ) đồng thời chụp ảnh chứng minh thư (thẻ căn cước) và sổ hộ khẩu gửi qua zalo số 0923.41.3663. Sau 2-3 ngày bên công an xác nhận hồ sơ hợp lệ thì quý khách có thể lựa chọn 2 phương án :  🍭 Phương án 1 : Chờ có hồ sơ cầm tay thì Quang Tuấn sẽ chụp ảnh và gửi cho khách hàng xác nhận sau đó chuyển nốt số tiền còn lại để Quang Tuấn Auto làm thủ tục gửi xe + hồ sơ. Thời gian rút hồ sơ từ 4-6 ngày, cá biệt với những xe mất giấy tự quản có thể lên đến 15 ngày (những trường hợp như vậy bên Quang Tuấn sẽ thông báo cụ thể)  🍭 Phương án 2 : Trong khi chờ có hồ sơ thì Quang Tuấn sẽ chuyển xe cho khách hàng trước, trước khi chuyển xe khách hàng vui lòng thanh toán toàn bộ số tiền còn lại (giữ lại 20 triệu để khi có hồ sơ thanh toán nốt). Sau khi có hồ sơ, Quang Tuấn lại chụp ảnh gửi cho khách hàng xác nhận, nếu đúng khách hàng thanh toán 20 triệu còn lại rồi Quang Tuấn Auto sẽ chuyển nốt giấy tờ còn lại. ✔ Quang Tuấn Auto đảm bảo giao xe đúng theo miêu tả trong video.

509,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,A5pUAMJ_gns,2019 Hyundai Palisade - Perfect SUV!,2018-12-15 10:50:07,"""All-New 2020 Hyundai Palisade Mid-size SUV       All-New 2020 Hyundai Palisade Flagship SUV Brings Exceptional Comfort, Technology and Safety in a Bold Midsize SUV     Palisade offers seating for up to eight and commodious cargo space with convenient features like power third-row seats and One-Touch second-row seats for ease of use     As Hyundai’s flagship SUV, Palisade offers a host of technology features ideal for family road trips including a 10-inch navigation display, wireless charging, seven USB outlets, second-row ventilated seats, shift-by-wire and innovative roof-based diffuser vents     Hyundai SmartSense technology comes standard on every Palisade Starting Pirce: $32.000  POWERTRAIN  Palisade power comes from an Atkinson-cycle 3.8-liter V6, dual CVVT, direct-injected engine, for excellent power and efficiency. This 3.8-liter powerplant produces an estimated 291 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm and an estimated 262 lb.-ft. of torque @ 5,000 rpm. Palisade offers more standard horsepower than any other SUV in its competitive set and an unsurpassed level of torque. Palisade delivers that power to the wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission with a multi-plate torque converter and offers both two-wheel and HTRAC® four-wheel-drive configurations, with a final drive ratio of 3.648 for confident acceleration. Special efforts were made to reduce Palisade NVH, with generous under-hood insulation, special sound-deadening carpets and powertrain tuning that delivers a smooth, linear response. In addition, Palisade offers drivers the ability to start the vehicle via remote key fob or via the Blue Link app.  FLAGSHIP SUV DESIGN  “Hyundai Palisade’s exterior and interior design clearly reflect its unique flagship identity with a premium, distinctive and bold road presence,” said SangYup Lee, head of Hyundai’s Design Center. “As the lead for Palisade design, it was a pleasure to work with our global design teams throughout its development and ultimately present this phenomenal product before you today.”  Palisade’s styling conveys dignity with style in an understated theme that demonstrates clear differentiation worthy of a flagship SUV. From the front, a dominant, bold and wide cascading grille clearly represents a premium SUV. Separated composite headlamps and a vertically-connected forward lighting signature create a strong and distinctive front demeanor, with available LED headlights, LED daytime running lights and LED turn-signal mirrors. A powerful, extended hood profile creates an impressive road presence, while bold C-pillars and a panoramic glass side graphic convey generous third-row spaciousness. Full volume over-fenders and body sides offer muscular detailing. The rear view emphasizes a wide and stable stance via sinuous detailing and a vertical LED rear taillamp design. Panoramic rear glass coupled with a cutaway roof provides a generous sense of spaciousness to rear passengers. Available oversized 20-inch alloy wheels further fill out the Palisade flagship presence.  This design has aerodynamic benefits as well, with a 0.33 coefficient of drag (Cd). Palisade achieves this low drag coefficient with specific design cues that include a fast A-pillar angle, a rear spoiler side garnish, an optimized front cooling area with an extended internal air guide, aero underside panels, and rear wheel aero deflectors.  INTUITIVE UTILITY  The interior design combines a sense of relaxation and comfort creating a serene environment with eight-passenger seating standard for family adventures. Leather-equipped models offer a premium, quilted Nappa leather, while on the instrument panel, smooth woodgrain trim in a wraparound interior design create a spacious, comfortable ambience. The One-Touch second row seat allows for one-touch operation of the seat forward and out of the way for easy access into and out of the third-row seat. For more convenience, the third row offers power-folding/unfolding and reclining seats. Second-row captain’s chairs are also available with ventilated seating surfaces. Every Palisade seating row offers USB outlets for convenience for all passengers, for a total of seven available USB outlets. Even more, a conversation mirror allows the driver to clearly see passengers in the rear.  Palisade also offers a class-exclusive Blind View Monitor that complements the standard Blind Spot Collision Avoidance Assist, which provides easy-to-see body-side views whenever the turn signal is activated. The audio and navigation display is a generous 10.25 inch touchscreen in widescreen format, coupled with a 12.3-inch fully-digital TFT center instrument cluster offering various view modes and differentiated drive mode illumination. Two Bluetooth® devices can be connected simultaneously, with one for a mobile phone connection and the other for audio streaming.

516,UCs_gcVRMHEx5mVXfQ7icQTg,2S4Khbv6iSw,2018 Hyundai Azera - interior Exterior and Drive,2017-06-26 13:45:36,"""The 2018 Hyundai Azera looks pretty classy   With the reveal of the new Azera, Hyundai has made it clear that it has no plans to leave the large, upscale sedan market. This South Korean Avalon-fighter underwent a significant redesign inside and out and will first go on sale in Korea next month.  Outside, the Azera has a significantly different and more formal, profile. While the previous model was rakish and wedgy, the new model adopts an upright version of Hyundai's new corporate grille, along with a long hood and more vertical windshield. The flanks also receive long, flowing character lines that give it a muscular appearance. At the back, the Azera gets a new version of the full width taillights that the model has had since the nameplate's introduction two generations ago.  The Azera also changes radically inside. Instead of the downward flowing dash of the old model, the new interior features an instrument panel that emphasizes width, with a dark top portion and lighter lower section. Sandwiched between the two halves of the dash is a section that rises up at the center stack to house the large touch screen and an analog clock, which looks a bit out of place.  Hyundai has yet to reveal any stats, pricing or availability for the new Azera, except for its aforementioned launch date in South Korea, where it will carry the Grandeur name. However, we would imagine more details will be coming soon ahead of its US launch.

For 2019, Hyundai is simplifying things with the Santa Fe Sport becoming just the Santa Fe and the 3-row version becoming the Palisade in 2020. Now in its 4th generation, this new model gains an 8-speed transmission and updated 4-cylinder engines with much improved fuel economy. Hyundai also took a bit more of a risk with the exterior and interior design and the result is a crossover that stands out from the crowd and provides an interesting option if you want something that is a little bigger then a compact but not quite a midsize SUV.""",266615,2455,152,0,810

552,UCGWNHkr2WZcRbxqoet-nyeg,ku8KLreAIjw,Hyundai Cradle Walking Car At CES 2019,2019-01-08 01:53:05,"""Any first responder will tell you that the first 72 hours following a natural disaster are the most crucial to saving lives. However, often times due to the nature of the disaster (forest fire, earthquake, hurricane, or flood), it can be difficult for search-and-rescue and humanitarian aid missions to reach and get immediate help to those in need.    The need for efficient, rapid, resilient transportation for disaster assistance is what led Hyundai to develop the first-ever vehicle with moveable legs. Elevate is the first Ultimate Mobility Vehicle (UMV), blending technology found in electric cars and robots, which allows it to traverse terrain beyond the limitations of even the most capable off-road vehicle.  """"When a tsunami or earthquake hits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field. They have to go the rest of the way by foot. Elevate can drive to the scene and climb right over flood debris or crumbled concrete,” said John Suh, Vice President and Head of Hyundai CRADLE. “This technology goes well beyond emergency situations. People living with disabilities worldwide that don’t have access to an ADA ramp could hail an autonomous Hyundai Elevate that could walk up to their front door, level itself, and allow their wheelchair to roll right in. The possibilities are limitless.”   The Elevate concept is based on a modular EV platform with the capability to switch out different bodies for specific situations. The robotic leg architecture has five degrees of freedom plus wheel hub propulsion motors and is enabled by the latest in electric actuator technology. This design is uniquely capable of both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits, allowing it to move in any direction.    The legs also fold up into a stowed drive-mode, where power to the joints is cut, and the use of an integrated passive suspension system maximizes battery efficiency. This allows Elevate to drive at highway speeds just like any other vehicle. But no other can climb a five foot wall, step over a five foot gap, walk over diverse terrain, and achieve a 15 foot wide track width, all while keeping its body and passengers completely level. Further, the combination of wheeled motion with articulating legs provides a new paradigm of mobility by enabling faster walking speeds, unique dynamic driving postures and torsional control at the end of each leg.   “By combining the power of robotics with Hyundai’s latest EV technology, Elevate has the ability to take people where no car has been before, and redefine our perception of vehicular freedom,” said David Byron, design manager, Sundberg-Ferar. “Imagine a car stranded in a snow ditch just 10 feet off the highway being able to walk or climb over the treacherous terrain, back to the road potentially saving its injured passengers – this is the future of vehicular mobility.”  Get More Great Car Videos - Subscribe: https://goo.gl/BSIaFc""",138215,2281,266,0,463

Tuy nhiên do nhiều khách hàng ở xa không có điều kiện đến xem xe thì có thể đặt mua xe từ xa. Đối với những chiếc xe bán từ xa thì Quang Tuấn Auto luôn có chế độ kiểm tra riêng biệt để hạn chế tối đa những bất tiện cho khách hàng khi nhận xe.  🌋 Để thực hiện phương thức mua bán từ xa (mua online), ban đầu quý khách hàng và Quang Tuấn Auto cần thống nhất chung về mức giá, phương thức vận chuyển, chi phí rút hồ sơ. Sau khi hai bên đã thống nhất xong thì quý khách vui lòng chuyển cho Quang Tuấn Auto 30 triệu tiền cọc để rút hồ sơ (nếu cần sang tên chính chủ ) đồng thời chụp ảnh chứng minh thư (thẻ căn cước) và sổ hộ khẩu gửi qua zalo số 0923.41.3663. Sau 2-3 ngày bên công an xác nhận hồ sơ hợp lệ thì quý khách có thể lựa chọn 2 phương án :  🍭 Phương án 1 : Chờ có hồ sơ cầm tay thì Quang Tuấn sẽ chụp ảnh và gửi cho khách hàng xác nhận sau đó chuyển nốt số tiền còn lại để Quang Tuấn Auto làm thủ tục gửi xe + hồ sơ. Thời gian rút hồ sơ từ 4-6 ngày, cá biệt với những xe mất giấy tự quản có thể lên đến 15 ngày (những trường hợp như vậy bên Quang Tuấn sẽ thông báo cụ thể)  🍭 Phương án 2 : Trong khi chờ có hồ sơ thì Quang Tuấn sẽ chuyển xe cho khách hàng trước, trước khi chuyển xe khách hàng vui lòng thanh toán toàn bộ số tiền còn lại (giữ lại 20 triệu để khi có hồ sơ thanh toán nốt).

558,UCFfFgeKVVhjXtQSXRj3e-Iw,A5pUAMJ_gns,2019 Hyundai Palisade - Perfect SUV!,2018-12-15 10:50:07,"""All-New 2020 Hyundai Palisade Mid-size SUV       All-New 2020 Hyundai Palisade Flagship SUV Brings Exceptional Comfort, Technology and Safety in a Bold Midsize SUV     Palisade offers seating for up to eight and commodious cargo space with convenient features like power third-row seats and One-Touch second-row seats for ease of use     As Hyundai’s flagship SUV, Palisade offers a host of technology features ideal for family road trips including a 10-inch navigation display, wireless charging, seven USB outlets, second-row ventilated seats, shift-by-wire and innovative roof-based diffuser vents     Hyundai SmartSense technology comes standard on every Palisade Starting Pirce: $32.000  POWERTRAIN  Palisade power comes from an Atkinson-cycle 3.8-liter V6, dual CVVT, direct-injected engine, for excellent power and efficiency. This 3.8-liter powerplant produces an estimated 291 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm and an estimated 262 lb.-ft. of torque @ 5,000 rpm. Palisade offers more standard horsepower than any other SUV in its competitive set and an unsurpassed level of torque. Palisade delivers that power to the wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission with a multi-plate torque converter and offers both two-wheel and HTRAC® four-wheel-drive configurations, with a final drive ratio of 3.648 for confident acceleration. Special efforts were made to reduce Palisade NVH, with generous under-hood insulation, special sound-deadening carpets and powertrain tuning that delivers a smooth, linear response. In addition, Palisade offers drivers the ability to start the vehicle via remote key fob or via the Blue Link app.  FLAGSHIP SUV DESIGN  “Hyundai Palisade’s exterior and interior design clearly reflect its unique flagship identity with a premium, distinctive and bold road presence,” said SangYup Lee, head of Hyundai’s Design Center. “As the lead for Palisade design, it was a pleasure to work with our global design teams throughout its development and ultimately present this phenomenal product before you today.”  Palisade’s styling conveys dignity with style in an understated theme that demonstrates clear differentiation worthy of a flagship SUV. From the front, a dominant, bold and wide cascading grille clearly represents a premium SUV. Separated composite headlamps and a vertically-connected forward lighting signature create a strong and distinctive front demeanor, with available LED headlights, LED daytime running lights and LED turn-signal mirrors. A powerful, extended hood profile creates an impressive road presence, while bold C-pillars and a panoramic glass side graphic convey generous third-row spaciousness. Full volume over-fenders and body sides offer muscular detailing. The rear view emphasizes a wide and stable stance via sinuous detailing and a vertical LED rear taillamp design. Panoramic rear glass coupled with a cutaway roof provides a generous sense of spaciousness to rear passengers. Available oversized 20-inch alloy wheels further fill out the Palisade flagship presence.  This design has aerodynamic benefits as well, with a 0.33 coefficient of drag (Cd). Palisade achieves this low drag coefficient with specific design cues that include a fast A-pillar angle, a rear spoiler side garnish, an optimized front cooling area with an extended internal air guide, aero underside panels, and rear wheel aero deflectors.  INTUITIVE UTILITY  The interior design combines a sense of relaxation and comfort creating a serene environment with eight-passenger seating standard for family adventures. Leather-equipped models offer a premium, quilted Nappa leather, while on the instrument panel, smooth woodgrain trim in a wraparound interior design create a spacious, comfortable ambience. The One-Touch second row seat allows for one-touch operation of the seat forward and out of the way for easy access into and out of the third-row seat. For more convenience, the third row offers power-folding/unfolding and reclining seats. Second-row captain’s chairs are also available with ventilated seating surfaces. Every Palisade seating row offers USB outlets for convenience for all passengers, for a total of seven available USB outlets. Even more, a conversation mirror allows the driver to clearly see passengers in the rear.  Palisade also offers a class-exclusive Blind View Monitor that complements the standard Blind Spot Collision Avoidance Assist, which provides easy-to-see body-side views whenever the turn signal is activated. The audio and navigation display is a generous 10.25 inch touchscreen in widescreen format, coupled with a 12.3-inch fully-digital TFT center instrument cluster offering various view modes and differentiated drive mode illumination. Two Bluetooth® devices can be connected simultaneously, with one for a mobile phone connection and the other for audio streaming.

576,UCGWNHkr2WZcRbxqoet-nyeg,ku8KLreAIjw,Hyundai Cradle Walking Car At CES 2019,2019-01-08 01:53:05,"""Any first responder will tell you that the first 72 hours following a natural disaster are the most crucial to saving lives. However, often times due to the nature of the disaster (forest fire, earthquake, hurricane, or flood), it can be difficult for search-and-rescue and humanitarian aid missions to reach and get immediate help to those in need.    The need for efficient, rapid, resilient transportation for disaster assistance is what led Hyundai to develop the first-ever vehicle with moveable legs. Elevate is the first Ultimate Mobility Vehicle (UMV), blending technology found in electric cars and robots, which allows it to traverse terrain beyond the limitations of even the most capable off-road vehicle.  """"When a tsunami or earthquake hits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field. They have to go the rest of the way by foot. Elevate can drive to the scene and climb right over flood debris or crumbled concrete,” said John Suh, Vice President and Head of Hyundai CRADLE. “This technology goes well beyond emergency situations. People living with disabilities worldwide that don’t have access to an ADA ramp could hail an autonomous Hyundai Elevate that could walk up to their front door, level itself, and allow their wheelchair to roll right in. The possibilities are limitless.”   The Elevate concept is based on a modular EV platform with the capability to switch out different bodies for specific situations. The robotic leg architecture has five degrees of freedom plus wheel hub propulsion motors and is enabled by the latest in electric actuator technology. This design is uniquely capable of both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits, allowing it to move in any direction.    The legs also fold up into a stowed drive-mode, where power to the joints is cut, and the use of an integrated passive suspension system maximizes battery efficiency. This allows Elevate to drive at highway speeds just like any other vehicle. But no other can climb a five foot wall, step over a five foot gap, walk over diverse terrain, and achieve a 15 foot wide track width, all while keeping its body and passengers completely level. Further, the combination of wheeled motion with articulating legs provides a new paradigm of mobility by enabling faster walking speeds, unique dynamic driving postures and torsional control at the end of each leg.   “By combining the power of robotics with Hyundai’s latest EV technology, Elevate has the ability to take people where no car has been before, and redefine our perception of vehicular freedom,” said David Byron, design manager, Sundberg-Ferar. “Imagine a car stranded in a snow ditch just 10 feet off the highway being able to walk or climb over the treacherous terrain, back to the road potentially saving its injured passengers – this is the future of vehicular mobility.”  Get More Great Car Videos - Subscribe: https://goo.gl/BSIaFc""",138332,2283,266,0,463

However, #Hyundai wants the world to know that they are serious about being a world class automaker and performance needs to be part of that recipe, which is where the N motorsports division comes in. The 2019 #VelosterN takes everything we already love about the regular #Veloster and pumps everything to 11. With up to 275 HP from a revised 2.0L turbo engine, a slick-shifting 6-speed manual transmission with a limited slip differential, and a soundtrack worthy of a true #hothatch emanating from glorious active exhaust system and what you're looking at here could very well be the turning point for Hyundai with the enthusiast market.

Generasi baru Hyundai Sante Fe ini mengaplikasikan bahasa desain baru Hyundai yang sudah terlihat di Hyundai Kona. Meski mesin bensin dan dieselnya masih relatif sama dengan yang lama, perubahan desain luar dan dalam dari SUV andalan Hyundai ini berhasil memancarkan kepiawaian mereka dalam hal mendesain mobil.  Namun apakah mobil ini benar-benar memukau hingga ke fitur dan detail-detailnya? Apakah pantas dengan banderolnya?",462792,5675,203,0,970
